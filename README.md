# live-astronomical-data
Thank you to Paul Schlyter and his resource (http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html) for making this possible.

This script calculates and displays live data on the Moon and Sun.

If you run the script with your command line you will be asked to type either "moon" or "sun".

You would then receive something like the following respectively:

Distance: 382,308 km (237,555 mi)    
Time for light to reach Earth: 0 minutes 1.3 seconds  
Right ascension: 07h 26m 27s (111.6142 degrees)  
Declination: 24° 02' 16" (24.0379 degrees)  

or
